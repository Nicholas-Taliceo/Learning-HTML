# Learning-HTML
This repository contains the materials associated with my learning and understanding of HTML/CSS.  There is not necessarily any "new" material other than the unique website that this repository creates.  That said, this website was created with the material posted on the site itself.

## Website Link
The following is the link to the most current version of this website, which is provided by the GitHub servers:

<a href="https://nicholas-taliceo.github.io/Learning-HTML/" target="_blank">Nick's HTML Website</a>

# Contents

## Main Folder
The main folder (called Learning-HTML) contains the main files associated with the website as well as the relevant folders that contain the additional webpages.  The following documents are in the main folder.
* [index.html](index.html)--This is the main file that contains the essential code for the website to run.  This is the **main** file.
* [README.md](README.md)--This file! It describes the details of this repository.
* [stylesheet.css](stylesheet.css)--This is the file that contains the CSS styling code for [index.html](index.html).

Each of the following folders predominantley contain two files:
1. folder_name.html--The HTML document that supports that specific web page, and,
2. stylesheet.css--The CSS document that allows for that webpage's specific formatting.  Since I am using the same formatting and styling for the *entire* website, the CSS documents are essentially copies of the main [stylesheet.css](stylesheet.css) in the main folder.
