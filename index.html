        <h4>About</h4>
          <p>
            Hello, world!  My name is Nicholas Taliceo and this is my educational</em> website about HTML and CSS!
          </p>
          <p>
            The main goal of this website is to provide a resource for HTML and CSS as I teach myself the markup language.  Most, if not all of these website will <em>not</em> be my own creations, but rather useful websites and tutorials that are already on the web.  Perhaps, at some point, I will begin to include unique work to this website, but that will be far in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's more, this website has been created <strong>entirely in HTML/CSS</strong> by me alone.  Of course, many of these aforementioned websites helped significantly in the creation of this website, but ultimately it was I who created it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have any questions for me (Nicholas Taliceo) or wish to view other creations by me, please feel free to drop me a line at the email link (above) or take a look at my personal webpage at the link below.
